            Background

        <p>
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The
            disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. As of July 17th, 2021, nearly 200
            million COVID-19 cases have be confirmed worldwide, and the virus has claimed more than 4 million lives
            globally.<br>
            <br>
            A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that
            causesCOVID‑19. Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure
            and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
            respiratory syndrome (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine technologies
            during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe
            illness. On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19
            March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19. The COVID‑19
            vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and death caused by COVID-19.
